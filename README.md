qwb
===

QtQuick Web Browser - A web browser using QML and Chromium.

This project requires Qt 5 with QtQuick and QtWebEngine.

**This project is unfinished, and is missing many features.** If you can get PySide + Qt4 running, you may be
interested in this project's predecessor, [Coconut](https://osdn.net/projects/coconut/).


Building and Running
--------------------

To build the project:
```bash
qmake-qt5
make
```

You can then run the resulting `qwb` binary!
